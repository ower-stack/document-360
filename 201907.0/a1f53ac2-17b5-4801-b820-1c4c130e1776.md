## Description

Spryker Docker SDK helps to set up docker environment for your Spryker project.

Spryker Docker SDK requires the [Deploy file](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/deploy-file-reference-version-1-201907). The tool reads the specified Deploy file and builds a production-like Docker infrastructure for Spryker accordingly.

The purposes of the tool:

1. Building production-like Docker images.
2. Serving as a part of development environment based on Docker.
3. Simplifying the process of setting up a local demo of Spryker project.

@(Error)()(All the commands below should be run from the root directory of Spryker project.)

## Installation

1. Fetch Docker SDK tools:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git ./docker
```
@(Warning)()(Make sure `docker 18.09.1+` and `docker-compose 1.23+` are installed in the local environment.)
2. Initialize docker setup:
 ```shell
docker/sdk bootstrap
```
3. Build and run Spryker applications:
```shell
docker/sdk up
```
@(Warning)()(Make sure all the domains from `deploy.yml` are defined as `127.0.0.1` in the `hosts` file in the local environment.)

## Getting Started

There are two ways to start working with Spryker in Docker:

* If you want to set up a new Spryker project in Docker, start with [Getting Started with Docker](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/getting-started-with-docker-201907).
* If you already have a DevVM based project, proceed to [Integrating Docker into an Existing Project](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/integrating-docker-into-an-existing-project-201907) to convert your project into a Docker based one.
