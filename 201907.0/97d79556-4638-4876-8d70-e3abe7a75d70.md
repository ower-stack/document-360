Spryker provides the [Company Account](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/company-account-overview) feature that allows purchasing goods and performing other actions on behalf of a user's company. The endpoints provided by the Company API allow retrieving information on companies.

@(Warning)(Authentication)(The endpoints provided by this API cannot be accessed anonymously. To access them, you need to impersonate users as Company Accounts and pass the authentication tokens received. For details on how to authenticate and retrieve such a token, see [Logging In as Company User](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/logging-in-as-company-user-201907).)

In your development, the API can help you to provide information on the company that the authenticated user belongs to.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [GLUE: Company Account Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/company-account-api-feature-integration-201907)
