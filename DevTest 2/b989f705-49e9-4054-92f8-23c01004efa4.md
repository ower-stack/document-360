## Upgrading from version 1.* to 2.*
From version 2 we have removed the disabled users from the shared list. The ability to enable/disable users was added to the `CompanyUser` module, version 2.0.0.
To upgrade to the new version of the module, do the following:
1. Upgrade the `CompanyUser` module to version 2.0.0. See [Migration Guide - CompanyUser](https://docs.demo-spryker.com/v1/docs/mg-companyuser) for more details:
```yaml
composer require spryker/company-user: “^2.0.0”
```
2. Regenerate transfer objects:
```yaml
vendor/bin/console transfer:generate
```

*Estimated migration time: 10 minutes*
