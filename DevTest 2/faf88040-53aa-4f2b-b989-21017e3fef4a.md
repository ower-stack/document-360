## Documentation Search
There are two ways **to find the information**  you are looking for:
1. Using the Search function. Documentation search complies with the main Google search rules:
* Search for an Exact Match: To search for an exact word or phrase, put it inside quotes. For example, `"shopping cart"`.
* Using Boolean Operators: You can use boolean operators to combine searches, search for one word or the other and exclude search terms.
* Use AND searches in Academy to search for all the search terms you specify. For example, type `shopping AND cart` to make sure each search result includes both the words "shopping" and "cart".
* To search for one word or the other one, put OR between each search query. For example, if you type `payone OR payment` the found articles will contain either word "payone" or "payment".
* To exclude specific search terms from the search results, put NOT before them. For example, type `payment NOT payone`: the query will not return any results with word "payone" in them.
2. Opening the sections. To find a specific piece of information, you can go to a section the information refers to (About, Features, Administration Interface, Back-End etc.), and search there.

To simplify documentation search and categorization, we mark some content with specific icons at the page title:
![B2B_Shop](https://cdn.document360.io/9fafa0d5-d76f-40c5-8b02-ab9515d3e879/Images/Documentation/B2B_Shop.png) icon or **B2B Shop tag** mean that the feature / topic in question is applied to [B2B shop](http://documentation.spryker.com/about_spryker/understanding_spryker/demoshops.htm#b2b-demo-shop) only; 
![B2C_Shop](https://cdn.document360.io/9fafa0d5-d76f-40c5-8b02-ab9515d3e879/Images/Documentation/B2C_Shop.png) icon or **B2C Shop tag** stand for [B2C shop](http://documentation.spryker.com/about_spryker/understanding_spryker/demoshops.htm#b2c-demo-shop) features / topics;
![Demoshop](https://cdn.document360.io/9fafa0d5-d76f-40c5-8b02-ab9515d3e879/Images/Documentation/Demoshop.png) icon or **Demoshop tag** signify that feature / topic refers to the [Legacy Demoshop](http://documentation.spryker.com/about_spryker/about-spryker.htm#what-is-the--legacy-demoshop---) only.

If content is not marked with either B2B, B2C or Demoshop icons, it is generic and applies to all shop types.
