[Product labels](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/dynamic-product-labels) are used to draw your customers' attention to some specific products. Each of them has a name, a priority, and a validity period. The Product Labels API provides endpoints for getting labels via the REST HTTP requests.

@(Info)(Note)(Product labels are available only for abstract products.)

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Product Labels API](https://documentation.spryker.com/v3/docs/promotions-and-discounts-feature-integration-201907){target="_blank"}.

## Get Product Label by ID
To retrieve a product label, send this GET request:

[/product-labels/{{label-id}}](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/rest-api-reference#/product-labels)

Sample request: *GET http://mysprykershop.com/product-labels/3*

where **3** is the ID of the label you want to retrieve.
Label IDs can be found in the **Products > Product Labels** section of the Back Office.
