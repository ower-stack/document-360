Product relations help shop owners to promote the related goods as well as to point the customers' attention to the goods that they may also want to see.

Product relations are built on the abstract product and not concrete products. One abstract product can have from one to many product relations. Once you define a product to which a relation is added, you need to also set a specific set of rules, or even a group, under which the relation is going to be built. Keep in mind that this is a one-way relation, meaning that only the product that you have defined will have the Similar Products section on its PDP (product details page) or in the cart, depending on the relation type. But the related product(s) that you assign to it will not get the same view unless you perform the same procedure for each individual item [to tie it to any other in the Back Office](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/product-relations-management).

## Product Relation Types
In Spryker, currently, Shop Administrators can define two types of relations: related products and upselling.

| Related Products | Upselling |
| --- | --- |
| With this type of relation, similar products are displayed on the product detail page for the currently selected abstract product. | With this type of relation, similar products are displayed on the cart overview page when a specific abstract product is added to the cart. |

## Product Relations Update
Product Relations can be updated in 2 possible ways:

* manually
* by means of a scheduled update

### Manual Update
If the user changes the product relation itself and saves the changes, the [sync](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/publish-and-synchronization#synchronize) event is triggered and the product relation is updated in Redis.

### Scheduled Update
Console command `product-relation:update` performs the scheduled update of the product relation. All the active product relations flagged with `is_rebuild_scheduled` will be updated. The command is triggered under the following conditions:

* when the **"Update regularly"** checkbox is checked in the **Back Office > Product Relations > Create/Edit Product Relation** section. The console command `product-relation:update` ensures that the product relation is actual and valid.

* A change happens according to the conditions in the Product Relation.

@(Info)(Example)(The related products are assigned with the query “category equals computer" and "Update regularly" is checked: every time anything changes in the category, for example, the products get unassigned, then with the scheduler the changes will be reflected in the product relation in Yves (so if products are unassigned from category, they will disappear from the relation, if category is renamed and doesn’t match the query, then the related products section will be empty / disappear from Yves).)

If two relations exist for the same product and one is flagged update regularly and the other one is not - then both relations will be updated.

## Database Entity Relation Schema - Product

| Database Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `spy_product_relation.fk_product_abstract` | This is the product for which the relation is built. |
| `spy_product_relation.is_active` | Defines that if the relation is not active it will still be exported, but not visible. |
| `spy_product_relation_product_abstract.fk_product_abstract` | This is the related product. |
| `spy_product_relation_product_abstract` | This is the order in which products should be listed when rendering relations. |

### Query Builder - Product Relation
Query builder in Zed allows selecting and building a dynamic related product query.

The query ships with pre-set rules:

* SKU - filter by an abstract product SKU.
* name - filter by an abstract product name. The locale is Zed’s default locale.
If a product matches in that locale it will be related in both locales.

* created_at - string value date when the abstract product was created.
* category - the name of the category in the current Zed locale.
* attributes - the list of attributes as defined in the  `spy_product_attribute_key` database table.

These rules can be combined with and or or operators and it is also possible to nest them to make complex rules.

When a product relation form in a saved configured rule is executed, all matching abstract product ids are saved in the `spy_product_relation_product_abstract` relation table.

When a query is selected and relation is saved, the relation needs to be manually updated to reflect the latest changes (run again the given query). The console command `product-relation:update` will run all the active relations with the `is_rebuild_scheduled` flag selected in the `spy_product_relation` database table.

This command can also be executed by spryker cron jobs and manually triggered via Jenkins.

### Yves Datastore Collector - Product Relation
The product relation collector exports relations to the Yves data store.

This collector is located in the `ProductRelationCollector` module.

Include this module in your `composer.json` file and update.
Then, add the `ProductRelationCollectorPlugin` plugin from this module to `\Pyz\Zed\Collector\CollectorDependencyProvider::provideBusinessLayerDependencies`.

```php
<?php
$container[static::STORAGE_PLUGINS] = function (Container $container) {
    return [
        ...
        ProductRelationConstants::RESOURCE_TYPE_PRODUCT_RELATION => new ProductRelationCollectorPlugin(),
    ];
};
?>
```

The new collector uses a `product_relation` type in the touch table.

## Current Constraints
Currently, the feature has the following functional constraints which are going to be resolved in the future.

* you cannot define a product relation for a single store
* you cannot define more than 1 relation of the same type for a product
