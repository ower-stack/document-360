Shop owners can decide which resources are available to unauthenticated customers, and which of them are not be allowed to view. In Spryker frontend, this is done via the Managing Customer Access Feature. On the REST API side, the capability is supported by the **Customer Access API**. The API allows protecting resources from access by unauthorized customers and also provides an endpoint that returns a list of resources protected from unauthenticated access.
:::(Warning) ()
An attempt to retrieve any of the resources protected by the API without authentication will result in a **403 Forbidden** error.
:::
In your development, the API will help you to protect certain resources from guest access, as well as perform pre-flight checks to avoid accessing endpoints that a guest user doesn't have sufficient permissions to view.
