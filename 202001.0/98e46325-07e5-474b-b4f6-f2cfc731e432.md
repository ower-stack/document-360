The Legacy Demoshop Front-end guides provide information of how the front-end was built in the [Legacy Demoshop](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/about-spryker#what-is-the--legacy-demoshop--). Here you will find the following information:

* [Overview of the Twig Template Engine](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/twig-overview) used for building the front-end;
* [Twig Templates best practices](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/twig-best-practices) providing in-depth information on how to extend Twig templates: create pages in Zed, add multiple widgets to pages, add forms etc.

The [Demoshop Guide](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/demoshop-guide)  will work you through the process of building your assets. The assets is a set of resources used to build the UI, that includes html, css (or less, sass, stylus, etc.) and js (or jsx, etc.) files, images, fonts and so on.

Assets represent a large collection of files, and to manage them effectively, we came up with the following 4-step procedure:

1. [Download and structure](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/download-structure): get external dependencies and put assets into the corresponding folders;
2. [Development](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/development): create your project front-end;
3. [Transpile/build and optimization](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/build-optimization): manipulate and optimize assets;
4. [Public folder](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/public-folder): place built output into a public and accessible folder.

We use the following path aliases to help you dive into the assets docs:

* `@project`: your project root folder;
* `@core`: Spryker core folder, usually (but not necessary) `@project/vendor/spryker`.
