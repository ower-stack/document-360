## General Information
This page describes the how you can get direct access to the services shipped with Spryker in Docker by default.  Find the list of the services you can get direct access to below:

*     ElasticSearch
*     Kibana UI
*     RabbitMQ
*     Swagger UI
*     Redis

:::(Info) ()
* Before proceeding to configuring a service, make sure to install or update Docker SDK to the latest version:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git ./docker
```
 
* After enabling a service, make sure to apply the new configuration:
    1. Bootstrap docker setup:
    ```bash
    docker/sdk boot {deploy.dev.yml}
    ```

    2. Once the job finishes, build and start the instance:
    ```bash
    docker/sdk up
    ```

## ElasticSearch

 Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. It provides a distributed, multitenant-capable full-text search engine with an HTTP web interface and schema-free JSON documents. 

See [Configuring Elasticsearch](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/search-configure-elasticsearch) to learn more about Elastcisearch configuration in Spryker.

### Configuration

Adjust `deploy.*.yml` in the `services:` section to open the port used for accessing ElasticSearch:
```yaml
services:
    search:
    engine: elastic
    endpoints:
        localhost:9200
           protocol: tcp
```
 
## Kibana UI

Kibana is an open source analytics and visualization platform designed to work with Elasticsearch. You use Kibana to search, view, and interact with data stored in Elasticsearch indices. You can easily perform advanced data analysis and visualize your data in a variety of charts, tables, and maps.

In Docker SDK, Kibana UI is provided as a service by default.

### Configuration

1. Adjust `deploy.*.yml` in the services: section:
```yaml
services:
    ...
    kibana:
      engine: kibana
      endpoints:
         kibana.spryker.local:
```
2. Adjust host file:
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 kibana.spryker.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## RabbitMQ

RabbitMQ is a messaging broker - an intermediary for messaging. It gives your applications a common platform to send and receive messages, and your messages a safe place to live until received.

### Configuration

Adjust `deploy.*.yml` in the `services:` section to open the port used for accessing RabbitMQ:
```yaml
services:
 broker:
 ...
 endpoints:
 ... 
     localhost:5672:
           protocol: tcp
     api.queue.spryker.local:
```
## Swagger UI

Swagger UI allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. It’s automatically generated from your OpenAPI (formerly known as Swagger) Specification, with the visual documentation making it easy for back end implementation and client-side consumption.

In Docker SDK, Swagger UI is provided as a service by default.

### Rest API Reference in Spryker

Spryker provides the basic functionality to generate [OpenApi schema specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) for REST API endpoints. This document provides an overview of REST API endpoints. For each endpoint, you will find the URL, REST request parameters as well as the appropriate request and response data formats.

### Configuration

    
1. Run the command to install the required Docker SDK version:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk.git 1.3.0 ./docker
```
2. Adjust `deploy.*.yml` in the `services:` section:
```yml	
services:
    ...
    swagger:
      engine: swagger-ui
      endpoints:
         {endpoint}:
```

3. Adjust the `host` file:
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 {endpoint name e.g swagger.spryker.local}" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

## Redis

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, geospatial indexes with radius queries and streams. 

### Configuration


```yml
services:
    key_value_store:
    engine: redis
    endpoints:
        localhost:16379:
           protocol: tcp
```
