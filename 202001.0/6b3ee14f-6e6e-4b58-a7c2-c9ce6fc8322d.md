## Creating a Warehouse
To create a warehouse:

1. On the **Warehouses** page, click **Create Warehouse** in the top right corner.
The **Create warehouse** page with two tabs opens - **Configuration** and **Store relation**. See *Warehouses: Reference information* for more details.
2. In the **Configuration** tab, do the following:
    * **Name**: Enter the name of the warehouse you want to create. 
    * **Is this warehouse available?**: Select *Yes* if you want to make your warehouse available (active) or *No* if you want to make your warehouse unavailable (inactive).
3. (optional) Switch to the **Store relation** tab. By default, the warehouse you are creating will be available for all the stores you have.
To make your warehouse unavailable for a specific store(s), clear the checkbox for that(those) store(s).

@(Warning)()(Keep in mind that if you clear all checkboxes for stores assigned to a specific warehouse, this warehouse won't appear on the **Edit Stock** page.)

4. To keep the changes, click **Save**. This will redirect you to the **Warehouses** page where you can see the new warehouse in the table and the following message: '*Warehouse has been successfully saved*'.
