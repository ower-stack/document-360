## Discounts Based on Shipment

It is possible to create a discount rule based on a carrier company, a delivery method or a shipment price.

To have a discount calculated based on a delivery method, select the `shipment-method` rule in the **Back Office > Discount > Edit discount > Discount calculation** section. Then, the discount will be applied only to the shipment expense with the chosen method. You could also select the `shipment-method` rule for the **Conditions** tab to define that your discount will be applied only when the order will be delivered by the chosen method.

The same approach works for a carrier company (shipment-carrier) and a price (shipment.price). You could combine these rules together based on your requirements.

Follow the steps below to activate this feature:

1. Install the `ShipmentDiscountConnectormodule` in your project.

2. Activate the **Decision** rule and the Collector plugins in  `\Pyz\Zed\Discount\DiscountDependencyProvider`
  
```php
  <?php

namespace Pyz\Zed\Discount;

use Spryker\Zed\ShipmentDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DecisionRule\ShipmentCarrierDecisionRulePlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ShipmentDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DecisionRule\ShipmentMethodDecisionRulePlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ShipmentDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DecisionRule\ShipmentPriceDecisionRulePlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ShipmentDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DiscountCollector\ItemByShipmentCarrierPlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ShipmentDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DiscountCollector\ItemByShipmentMethodPlugin;
use Spryker\Zed\ShipmentDiscountConnector\Communication\Plugin\DiscountCollector\ItemByShipmentPricePlugin;
...

class DiscountDependencyProvider extends SprykerDiscountDependencyProvider
{

    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Zed\Discount\Dependency\Plugin\DecisionRulePluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getDecisionRulePlugins()
    {
        return array_merge(parent::getDecisionRulePlugins(), [
            ...
            new ShipmentCarrierDecisionRulePlugin(),
            new ShipmentMethodDecisionRulePlugin(),
            new ShipmentPriceDecisionRulePlugin(),
        ]);
    }

    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Zed\Discount\Dependency\Plugin\CollectorPluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getCollectorPlugins()
    {
        return array_merge(parent::getCollectorPlugins(), [
            ...
            new ItemByShipmentCarrierPlugin(),
            new ItemByShipmentMethodPlugin(),
            new ItemByShipmentPricePlugin(),
        ]);
    }

}
```

3. You are ready to use the shipment discounts.
