In corporate environments, where users act as company representatives rather than private buyers, companies can leverage [Company Roles](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/company-roles-permissions-overview) in order to distribute scopes and permissions among [Company Users](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/company-account-overview). To identify which roles company users are assigned to, you can use the endpoints provided by the **Company Role API**.

@(Warning)(Authentication)(The endpoints provided by this API cannot be accessed anonymously. To access them, you need to impersonate users as **Company Accounts** and pass the authentication tokens received. For details on how to authenticate and retrieve such a token, see [Logging In as Company User](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/logging-in-as-company-user-201907).)

In your development, the endpoint can help you to identify the roles existing in the company of the currently logged in user.

## Installation
For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Company Account Feature Integration](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/company-account-integration-201907).

## Retrieving Company Role Information
### Roles Performed by the Current User
To retrieve information on the Company Roles assigned to the currently logged in Company User, send a GET request to the following endpoint:

[/company-roles/mine](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/rest-api-reference#//company-roles)

Sample request: *GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/company-roles/mine*

@(Warning)(Note)(You can use the **Accept-Language** header to specify the locale.Sample header: `[{"key":"Accept-Language","value":"de, en;q=0.9"}]` where **de**, **en** are the locales; **q=0.9** is the user's preference for a specific locale. For details, see [14.4 Accept-Language](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.4){target="_blank"}.)
