## Upgrading from Version 2.* to Version 3.*
ProductPageSearch 3.0.0 got separate search index for Concrete Products. It includes database table and ElasticSearch index.

To perform the migration, follow the steps:

1. Run the database migration: 
```Bash
vendor/bin/console propel:install
```
2. Generate transfers:
```Bash:
vendor/bin/console transfer:generate
```
3. Install search:
```Bash:
vendor/bin/console search:setup
```
4. Sync concrete products data with ElasticSearch:

```
or 
```Bash

```

*Estimated migration time: ~2h*
