Each module ships with a `DependencyProvider` class which explicitly defines services and external dependencies to other modules. For instance when the Cms module requires the Glossary module this needs to be configured here. The `DependencyProvider` defines dependencies for each layer. Usually you require some of these classes:

* Services (Common functionality for Client, Yves and Zed)
* Plugins
* Facades
* Query Containers

As you can see in the example these required classes are wrapped into a closure to enable lazy loading. Inside of the closure you get a $container variable which gives you access to a so called [service locator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern) to retrieve the required classes like this: `$container->getLocator()->glossary()->facade()`.

@(Warning)()(You can use any module name instead of `->glossary()`. The structure is always the same so you can copy and adopt it for your use case.)

```php
<?php
class CmsDependencyProvider extends SprykerCmsDependencyProvider
{

    const FACADE_GLOSSARY = 'FACADE_GLOSSARY';
    const MY_PLUGINS = 'MY_PLUGINS';
    const SERVICE_UTIL_SANITIZE = 'SERVICE_UTIL_SANITIZE';

    public function provideBusinessLayerDependencies(Container $container)
    {
        // Provide access to a facade from another bundle (Glossary in this example)
        $container[static::FACADE_GLOSSARY] = function (Container $container) {
            return $container->getLocator()->glossary()->facade();
        }

        // Provide a stack of plugins from other bundles
        $container[static::MY_PLUGINS] = function (Container $container) {
            return [
                new APlugin(),
                new BPlugin(),
            ];
        };

        // Provide a service from another bundle (UtilSanitize in this example)
        $container[static::SERVICE_UTIL_SANITIZE] = function (Container $container) {
            return $container->getLocator()->utilSanitize()->service();
        };
    };
}
```

## How to Use the Provided Class?

You can access the classes which are provided by the `DependencyProvider` in the [Factory](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/factory). Technically the `$container` variable is a simple [DI-container](http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html) based on [Pimple](http://pimple.sensiolabs.org/). The contained class is initialized only when you use it.

```php
<?php
class CmsBusinessFactory extends AbstractBusinessFactory
{
    /**
     * Returns an instance of the provided glossary facade.
     *
     * @return CmsToGlossaryInterface
     */
    protected function getGlossaryFacade()
    {
        return $this->getProvidedDependency(CmsDependencyProvider::FACADE_GLOSSARY);
    }
}
```

## Snippet for a New Dependency Provider
To create a new dependency provider you can copy and adopt the snippet. Just rename const `FACADE_FOO_BAR` and `fooBar()` according to your requirements.

```php
<?php
namespace Pyz\Zed\MyBundle;

use Spryker\Zed\Kernel\AbstractBundleDependencyProvider;
use Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container;

class MyBundleDependencyProvider extends AbstractBundleDependencyProvider
{
    const FACADE_FOO_BAR = 'FACADE_FOO_BAR';

    /**
     * @param Container $container
     *
     * @return Container
     */
    public function provideBusinessLayerDependencies(Container $container)
    {
        $container[static::FACADE_FOO_BAR] = function (Container $container) {
            return $container->getLocator()->fooBar()->facade();
        };

        return $container;
    }

}
```

New bundles will not be auto-completable in your IDE just yet. Run `vendor/bin/console dev:ide:generate-auto-completion` to also get IDE typehinting for those, the yellow “markup” will go away.

## Bridges in Spryker Core
When you look into dependency provider classes from the core level, you will discover the existence of bridges. Inside of Spryker’s Core we are using the [Bridge pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) to avoid hard dependencies and to further decouple the bundles form each other.

@(Warning)()(This is not needed in the project code and we recommend to avoid it to reduce overhead.)

```php
<?php
$container[static::FACADE_GLOSSARY] = function (Container $container) {
    // Here we return the bridge instead of the required facade. Core only!
    return new CmsToGlossaryBridge($container->getLocator()->glossary()->facade());
};
```

The same is true for services.
