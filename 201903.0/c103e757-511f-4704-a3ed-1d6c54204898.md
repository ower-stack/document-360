## Features
### CMS Blocks Per Store
We continue progressing towards full enablement of the multi-store concept. With this release, we are introducing a new multi-store CMS Blocks feature. It enables you to manage CMS blocks display per stores through a store toggle element on CMS Block management pages in the Administration Interface. To define which store(s) a CMS block should be visible in, just select the respective store(s) under "Store relation".

### Time To Live For Products
With this release, we are introducing a new feature that enables the shop administrator to set validity dates for products. With the Time To Live (TTL) For Products feature, you can easily define from and till when your product(s) will be visible and available for purchase by your customers without having to manage the inventory manually. This feature is extremely useful if you sell products with an expiry date, seasonal products or products that are valid for a certain period of time (e.g. tickets), or if for promotional reasons, you temporally sell some products within a limited time frame, or if you want to start selling some products (e.g. a collection) from a specific date and/or time. The product validity time can be set to up-to-the minute accuracy.

## Improvements
### Configurable Cookie Path
Previously, it was not possible to configure the `cookie_path` for the session cookie. From now on, you will have more flexibility in deciding how to set-up your store, as we have added a configuration option to define the cookie path for Yves and Zed so it can be configured according to the project's needs.

### Full Compatibility To Symfony 2.8 And Then 3.0

## Bugfixes
### User Role Saving Without Changes
Previously, when trying to save a user role without making any changes to it in the Administration Interface, an error message is displayed. This has been fixed now - when saving a user role without changing it, nothing happens.

### Error Message For Empty Mandatory Fields For CMS Page
Previously, we had the following issue: when trying to save a CMS page with empty mandatory fields for example, for DE translations (collapsed by default) in the Administration Interface, nothing happened - no error was shown. This issue has been fixed in this release - if mandatory fields, which are collapsed by default, are not filled out, they are expanded and highlighted.

### Mail Text Layout Fix

| n/a | n/a | [Mail 4.0.2](https://github.com/spryker/mail/releases/tag/4.0.2) |

### PropelOrm Issue With DateTimes
Earlier, we had an issue when saving users in the Administration Interface without making any changes: unchanged entities were still marked as modified. This was caused by the fact that all entities used different time formatting for DateTimes. When `toArray()` of an entity was used, DateTime was formatted with -&gt;format('c') but the setter always used -&gt;format('Y-m-d H:i:s.u'). This led to always changed entities. This issue is fixed now.
Please make sure you are not using any project implementation that relies on the count of changed rows in such a scenario.
