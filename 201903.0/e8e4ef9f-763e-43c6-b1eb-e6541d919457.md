A search engine is one of the most important functionalities in an online shops because it facilitates a better navigation, allowing the user to get to the products that are in his interest.

The search engine should return a small number of items that match the query.

Facets provide aggregated data based on a search query. For example, let’s say we need to query for all the shirts that are in color blue. The search engine has configured a facet on category and one on the color attribute. Therefore, the search query will be executed using these 2 facets. The search result will return the entries that are aggregated both in the category facet with shirt category ID and in the color facet with value blue.

## Category Facet Filter
`CatalogClient` enables creating a search query when a request is submitted. `CatalogClient` exposes 2 operations:

* `createFacetSearch(Request $request, array $category)`
* `createFulltextSearch(Request $request)`

Both operations can contain in the request other facet filters (such as color or size).

The main difference is that the full-text search operation will add in the search query the search string contained in the request while the facet search will add a facet filter on category id.

On the category detail page, the `createFulltextSearch(Request $request)` should be used, as in the example below:

```php
<?php
 public function indexAction(array $categoryNode, Request $request)
    {
        $search = $this->getFactory()
            ->getCatalogClient()
            ->createFacetSearch($request, $categoryNode);

        $response = $search->getResult();

        if ($request->isXmlHttpRequest()) {
            return $this->formatJsonResponse($response);
        }

        return $this->viewResponse($response);
    }
```
**Example:**
Making a request on the URL `http://www.de.demoshop.local/en/computers/notebooks` in Demoshop will be routed to the `CatalogController:indexAction` controller action, which is designated for category detail page.

A facet search will be executed using the category facet with the provided category node as a parameter.

## Configuring Facet Filters
As mentioned above, the category facet is a special case and needs to be handled this way because a call needs to be made to Redis to retrieve the category node ID when a category detail page is requested.

Other than that, both `CatalogClient` operations can handle requests that contain other facet filters.

You can integrate as many facet filters in your search query, as long as they are configured. The facet configuration is done in the `FacetConfig` class.

Keep in mind that the configuration you make in the `FacetConfig` must be in sync with the structure of the data that’s exported to `Elasticsearch`.

Also, keep in mind that even if you have the facets exported in Elasticsearch, without adding the necessary configuration in the FacetConfig you won’t be able to submit the correct queries.

The search attributes must be configured in the `$attributes[]` in the FacetConfig.

**Example:**

```php
<?php
    protected static $attributes = [
    //..
        'price' => [
            static::KEY_FACET_ACTIVE => true,
            static::KEY_SORT_ACTIVE => true,
            static::KEY_FACET_FIELD_NAME => static::FIELD_INTEGER_FACET,
            static::KEY_SORT_FIELD_NAME => static::FIELD_INTEGER_SORT,
            static::KEY_TYPE => static::TYPE_SLIDER,
            static::KEY_PARAM => 'price',
            static::KEY_RANGE_DIVIDER => '-',
        ],
    ];
```

Having the price attribute added to configuration as an active facet enables us to filter the products on the value of this attribute.

`http://www.de.demoshop.local/en/computers/notebooks?price=0-300` request will perform a search using the category and price facets. It will return the products that are under the notebooks category with price range between 0 and 300.

`http://www.de.demoshop.local/search?q=tablet&amp;price=0-300` request will perform a full-text search with search string tablet and with facet filter price(price in the range 0-300).
