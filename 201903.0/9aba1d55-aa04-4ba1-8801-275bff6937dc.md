A Demo Shop is a showcase that we publish to demonstrate our features in a live implementation. Demo Shops are also a great way to kick-start your own project.

As of the [November release](https://documentation.spryker.com/v4/docs/release-notes-2018-11-0), we offer two types of demo shops:

## B2B Demo Shop

Our new B2B Demo Shop is a showcase that is pre-loaded with a combination of modules and functionalities best suited for B2B commerce. This Demo Shop is our recommended starting point for all standard B2B commerce projects. It comes with the new modern look-and-feel and atomic design approach.
