Zedâ€™s persistence layer is the owner of the schema, entities and queries. This layer knows the database structure and holds the connection to it.

## Integrated Technologies

Propel	Fast and simple ORM Framework MySQL or PostgreSQL.	Both databases are supported

## Persistence Layer Elements:

| Query container   | A query container holds all the queries in the current module. |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Entities          | An entity represents a single row from the database.         |
| Queries           | Query objects provide an object-oriented API for writing database queries. |
| Schema definition | Xml-files that define the database schema for the related module. |
| Abstract factory  | The factory is used to instantiate query objects.            |

The following diagram shows how the elements interact:
