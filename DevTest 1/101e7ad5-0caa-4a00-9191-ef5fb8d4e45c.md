@(Info)()(This module release has been created for internal reasons and does not require migration efforts. Please [contact us](https://support.spryker.com/hc/en-us) if you have any questions.)

## Upgrading from Version 1.* to 2.*

The only one major change of `ProductPackagingUnitStorage` 2.x.x is adding dependency to `spryker/product-measurement-unit-storage:^1.0.0` which requires DB changes.
To perform the migration, follow the steps:
1. Install `spryker/product-measurement-unit-storage:^1.0.0`
2. Run database migration:
`vendor/bin/console propel:install`
3. Generate transfers:
`vendor/bin/console transfer:generate`

_Estimated migration time: ~1h._
